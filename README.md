## What is terraform
An open source infrastructure as code tool started by HashiCorp.<br/>
<br/>

### Infrastructure as code

*infrastructure as code*: Allows the use of high level descriptive programming language to describe and manage infrastructure.<br/>
Enabeling development, deployment and scale cloud applications with greater speed.<br/>

Infrastructure requirements are "codified" meaning that they are made into machine readable definition files that can be executed but can also be read and understood by another person.
- Allows repeatable environment builds
- Infrastructure templates can be preserved in version control software

## What is terraform

## Why use terraform 

## How does it work.

Everything in terraform work off of its configuration file. usually called main.tf.<br/>
This file doesnt explain steps of how to make an environment but instead describes the environment and its resources.

It is structured into blocks.<br/>
The most common blocks being..
- provider block 
- resources block
- local variables block

There are 4 main terraform commands.
- terraform init
- terraform plan
- terraform apply
- terraform destroy 

Terraform init is used to initialise the directory in which your configuration file will be in so that terraform can work there (explain better later).<br/>
